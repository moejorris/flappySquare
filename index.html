    <h1>Flappy Bird</h1>
    <h2>This is an arcade-style play until you lose game. Make the bird flap its wings to ascend.<br>
        Avoid the pipes and collect the coins in between to score! Yellow coins give you 10 points, orange gives you 25, and purple gives you 50.<br>
        Falling below or above the screen as well as hitting a pipe will make you lose a life. After losing a life you are invincible for 2 seconds. Refresh the page to play again!</h2>
